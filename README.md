    - Project 9:  Is a combination of concepts from projects 7/8.  It produces a timer like element and updates variables based on frequency and conditions set in coding.
    - Project 10:  Expands further on IF rules and introduces WHILE inflections.
    - Apache Project:  This project incorporates use of AJAX as well as APACHE server elements in order to communicate ine file to the browser based on the instructions from another file (html).  It formally executed the 0-1-2-3-4 approach to which all servers must be interacted with.
    - Calculator:  This project heavily incorporates the use of CSS and JavaScript to create a working calculator of which trackes and can update values, execute many math functions and be manually reset.
    - jQuery and Bootstrap:  This is an expansion on the movie theater website project.  It utilizes a series of base code from Bootstrap while referencing the appropriate jquery and respective bootstrap resources to run the code properly.  These are other examples of remote resources.
    - Pizza Menu:  This is a project that incorporates an assortment of CSS, JavaScript and HTML in order to execute.  User inputs and pre-programmed data yield a functioning receipt generator contingent upon user interactive inputs for what the order shall contain.
    - TicTacToe:  This incorporates a creative method oc using gameplayer inputs to create a history in the form of an array.  Upon various conditions, JavaScript incorporates canvas features, CSS elements etc in order to create an excellent UE.
    - jQuery:  This project uses examples of JQuery abbreviated JavaScript without an independend javascript file, however referencing the correct AJAX element to communicate with.
